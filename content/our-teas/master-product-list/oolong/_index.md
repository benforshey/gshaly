    "The most labor-intensive teas to produce, oolongs are withered, rolled, and allowed to oxidize in repeated cycles, often for several days at a time. This extremely technical production results in flavor profiles from ethereal and floral to richly honey-sweet. The G.S. Haly Companyâ€™s collection of oolong tea focuses on the famous and finest standards from Taiwan and China."
