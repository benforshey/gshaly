                    Michael Spillane has set the standard for tea professionals in the United States for nearly four decades. His profound love for and knowledge of tea, and his commitment to education and industry growth continue to inform every aspect of The G.S. Haly Company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mike grew up sweeping tea leaves and emptying the spittoon in The G.S. Haly Company offices. In 1977, he began working full-time with his mother, Marie Spillane, following her lead in developing relationships with tea producers, clients and colleagues around the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learning the ropes of the industry from long-established traders and tea-makers instilled in Mike a belief in the importance of education as the foundation of long-term business relationships. That this education be found through rigorous cupping, travel to origin, and thorough familiarity with all tea types has been intrinsic to The G.S. Haly Company ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the early 1980s, as the Specialty Coffee Association of America was building the foundations of a national coffee education movement, Mike took the opportunity to begin offering tea classes through <abbr title="Specialty Coffee Association of America">SCAA</abbr>. The popularity of these classes led him to create the American Premium Tea Institute (<abbr title="American Premium Tea Institute">APTI</abbr>), the first tea education program in the United States. <abbr title="American Premium Tea Institute">APTI</abbr> later evolved into today&rsquo;s Specialty Tea Institute (<abbr title="Specialty Tea Institute">STI</abbr>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like his father, Edward Spillane, Mike also served as chairman of the United States Tea Board of Experts from 1993 until 1995.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2016, in recognition of these contributions to the tea industry, the World Tea Expo honored Mike with a Lifetime Achievement Award.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mike was born into the tea industry and has spent the last 40 years shaping the American tea trade. His lifelong dream is to pass on his passion for tea to the next generation of tea professionals.

                <p>
                    Aaron Vick fell out of professional cooking and into the world of tea when he had his first tea cupping led by a professional trainer at Peet&rsquo;s Coffee &amp; Tea in 1997 in Berkeley, California. Inspired by that experience he spent ten years with Peet&rsquo;s as a staff educator, sharing the knowledge that inspired him and learning from some of the most experienced people in the industry. That community of tea people led him to The G.S. Haly Company where, as the senior tea buyer, Aaron is immersed in the daily discipline of cupping offers from the great specialty tea origins of the world and bringing them to the North American market. He also currently serves as a Judge for the North American Tea Championship and is a former board member and instructor for the Specialty Tea Institute and World Tea Expo.
