                <p>As direct importers, we facilitate the trade of tea straight from the farms and gardens worldwide. The long-term relationships we share with our suppliers, some spanning generations, allow us preferential access to some of the finest tea standards available, as well as limited, seasonal, and special production teas.</p>
                <p>We import teas from the regions of the world that have been producing tea for centuries: China, India, Sri Lanka, Japan and Taiwan. Because we work directly with these sources, we have access to highly detailed information and can offer a degree of transparency and traceability not available when intermediaries are involved.</p>
                <p>We have full access to all quality and safety requirements for legal tea importation and sale in the United States, and can provide additional testing and certifications upon request. We inspect all our teas for additional, origin-specific points of concern, and can arrange customized testing profiles upon request.</p>
