    "Though caffeine naturally occurs in tea leaves, there are several methods for removing all but 1â€“2% of it. The cleanest method, using carbon dioxide, is our preferred approach for preserving the inherent character of the tea: CO2 is brought to a super-critical concentration, which then acts as a solvent to specifically isolate caffeine molecules from the leaf. The G.S. Haly Company offers a range of straight and flavored decaf teas that have undergone this processing."
