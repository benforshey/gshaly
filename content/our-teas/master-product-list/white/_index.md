    "When *Camellia sinensis* leaves are spread out to wither and air-dry, they naturally develop a slightly darker color change, or partial oxidation. This simple style of tea production---no heat or physical manipulation is applied to the leaves---results in teas with nuanced, juicy, and floral character."
